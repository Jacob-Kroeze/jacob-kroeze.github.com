I've spent the last six months at work (Friday time) developing an
event-store in postgres.

It's interesting to decide which resources in a postgres database
should be a jsonb document or a relational group of tables. For
example, it's convenient to model users relationally to take advantage
of indexes and security features in the database. User-generated web
forms, on the other hand, could be stored as jsonb. Put the
configuration of a form and the data submitted in the jsonb type. (see
alpacajs.org for an example of user-configured forms).
