    <p>The potential for growth in marketing consulting may be based in the education of small business owners.  The University of Maryland's Smith School of Business conducted a survey in order to determine how small businesses currently use social media. From 2009 to 2010, small businesses doubled their adoption of new tech for social media, nearly half determined that their investments will be financially beneficial within the year. While this is a positive outlook, over half of small businesses surveyed decided that they were spending more time to develop a social media presence than they had predicted. Finally, In 2010, twitter was utilized by only 16% of businesses. <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/03/02/small-business-stats/">From "How Small Business Is Using Social Media," Jennifer Van Grove</a></p> 
    <p>From these statistics, it is clear that most small businesses are adopting social media.  More importantly for the prospective marketer, most small businesses need help to execute these marketing strategies. Where do small businesses need the most help with social media marketing? I propose each of the three major platforms provides a niche for marketing consultion. </p>
    <p><strong>Search.</strong>One benefit of social media is the shear mass of information about the customer's opinions and desires. The volume of information, however, requires expertise in using search tools to give meaning to the public's opinion. Google social search, Twitter search, and Facebook search as well as the old Google alerts should be monitored and recorded for analytics. Keep track of keywords searched, top results, and potential for meaning.</p>
    <p><strong>Analytics.</strong>Beyond staring at results of broad searches and monitoring keywords, inserting tracking tags into marketing campaigns will result in hard data. In combination with search results, using tools such as Google Analytics provide the info needed to make data-driven decisions. In the end, however, these tools have limits, and the critical thinking of a seasoned marketer needs to fill the niche of analyzing a tools' ouput.</p>
    <p><strong>Connections.</strong>As always, customers want a clear story from a small business. By connecting social media platforms in elegant ways, a marketing consultant will fill the niche of making a unified marketing strategy. Tweets, a Twitter followers "count", and a Facebook "likes" count should be on the business' blog. A business should thouroughly consider using the Facebook comments API, while being sure to have the man power to handle any comment backlash.Finally, connecting all promotions and discounts from the business to each profile may be the most import unifying marketing strategy of all.
    </p>
    <p>In my opinion, social media Search, Analytics, and Connections are the most complex and important aspects of a small business' social media marketing strategy. A marketing consultant should take advantage of each business' need to learn to develop these areas by providing online education, local classes, and an open phone line. In turn, providing these educational opportunities will turn into new client leads. </p>
